      description: >-
        <p>Adventurers of Orrorsh long ago learned lead bullets and steel blades
        were no match for the horrors of their realm. Alchemy proved a great
        help to their cause, and some intrepid souls eventually combined that
        arcane craft with the more practical skill of marksmanship.</p><p>When
        this Perk is taken, the user has a <q>slayer’s gun</q> and knows how to
        create various rounds for it. He receives his weapon and the knowledge
        to make basic metal slugs (damage 14) and any three of the specialized
        rounds below. Crafted for close encounters, the short-barrel carbine
        design of the slayer’s gun allows it to be used in melee like a
        pistol.</p><p>Because the bullets are necessarily large and require
        exacting specifications, monster hunters who make use of them have
        standardized a sixchambered, carbine-style gun to fire them—the rounds
        don’t work in any other kind of weapon.</p><ul><li><strong>Slayer’s
        Gun:</strong> Range 50/100/200, damage 14, Shots
        6</li></ul><p>Bulletsmiths can keep and maintain up to six special
        bullets as long as they have access to their gear (which always contains
        a small bullet-making kit). If more rounds are created, they lose the
        magical essence the Bulletsmith inherently provides and act as regular
        slugs (damage 14). Replacement rounds may be created between scenes, or
        during downtime if the Game Master feels it’s
        appropriate.</p><p>Slayer’s guns are designed to rotate quickly and so
        can fire any one of their preloaded six chambers (specified before use).
        Swapping or reloading up to three rounds is an
        action.</p><p><strong>Slayer’s Bandoleer:</strong> Monster hunters wear
        a specialized bandoleer designed to hold 18 shells total (12 regular
        shells and their six special rounds).</p><p><strong>Extra
        Shells:</strong> This Perk may be taken more than once. Each time after
        the first the Bulletsmith learns to make a new type of shell and may
        maintain two more special rounds at a time.</p><p>Here are some of the
        shells Bulletsmiths have thus far discovered:</p><ul><li><strong>Adamant
        Shell:</strong> Some of the Victorians’ foes are armored from head to
        toe with metal, scales, or even a carapace. These shells are designed to
        cut through them, causing Armor Piercing 4</li><li><strong>Electric
        Shell:</strong> Water-based creatures or creatures standing in water
        take an additional +4 damage when hit by electric shells. A previously
        unknown side-effect of these rounds is that they can cause glitches in
        high-tech <em>electronic</em> equipment. Robots and machines take the
        extra damage, and sensitive equipment shorts out and is inoperable for
        three rounds</li><li><strong>Explosive Shell:</strong> The most
        dangerous of the Bullet Smith’s shells causes damage 15 in a Small Blast
        Radius</li><li><strong>Giant Killer Shell:</strong> The Victorians
        developed these heavy shells to take down the Gaunt Man’s biggest
        horrors. They cause +5 damage against Large or greater
        creatures</li><li><strong>Holy Water Shell:</strong> +2 damage versus
        any supernaturally evil creature, including gospog, vampires, and
        undead</li><li><strong>Phantom Shell:</strong> These rounds are made
        from various reagents such as cold iron, salt, and holy water that
        allows them to affect ethereal creatures normally</li><li><strong>Silver
        Shell:</strong> Creatures with the Lycanthrope Special Ability take +4
        damage from silver shells</li><li><strong>Sun Shell:</strong> These
        rounds contain something the alchemists call <q>liquid sunlight.</q>
        They explode with ultraviolet light in a Medium Blast, causing any
        creatures <q>hit</q> by them to be Very Vulnerable if they have a
        sensitivity to light or sunlight. Most creatures that can see in
        darkness are affected by sun shells</li></ul>

      description: >-
        <p>Victorians are status conscious, and few are held in higher esteem
        than their heroes. The Victorians show this regard by awarding medals to
        the brave, the ingenious, and the intrepid. Sometimes the medals become
        imbued with their intent and aid the recipient in their quest to save
        Gaea.</p>

        <p><strong>New Medals:</strong> This Perk may be taken as desired during
        character creation. Afterwards, it may be taken multiple times, but only
        after completing the event described in the individual awards. The
        Dragon Slayer, for example, is awarded only after dealing the final blow
        to a huge monster.</p>

        <p>Medals don&rsquo;t arrive instantly, of course, but may be delivered
        by courier after the Home Office receives dispatches testifying to the
        deed, a loved one receives letters, or the press announces it to the
        world. The Delphi Council understands the mystical nature of these
        awards, however, and assists the Victorians in delivering them when
        possible. Work with the Game Master to figure out the timing of the
        medal itself, but it should generally occur no later than the act after
        it was earned. The Perk may be purchased once the medal itself is in
        hand.</p>

        <p>A medal must be awarded <em>and</em> worn to grant its power. They
        grant no bonuses to others.</p>

        <p>Medals may be awarded to outsiders from other cosms, but only have
        powers for those of Orrorsh&rsquo;s reality.</p>

        <p>Unless an award says otherwise, it is never granted more than
        once.</p>

        <ul>

        <li><strong>Carnifex Princeps:</strong> The Victorians know exactly who
        the Gaunt Man is. This award is granted to anyone who takes part in the
        killing of a ravagon, his fiercest lieutenants. The hero draws and adds
        an additional card to his hand at the start of any Dramatic Scene</li>

        <li><strong>Defender:</strong> Awarded to those who rescue or defend a
        significant number of people, such as a school or town, at great
        personal risk. The hero starts each act with one additional
        @UUID[Compendium.te001-core-rulebook.rules.pwneQ55M0nnDH0Us.JournalEntryPage.kYP18QiA72P6PlUi#possibilities]{Possibility}</li>

        <li><strong>Dragon Slayer:</strong> Awarded to those who defeat a very
        large and powerful monster. The character adds +1 BD to all damage
        totals against all Large or greater-sized creatures (not vehicles or
        constructs) when Attack is an Approved Action</li>

        <li><strong>Order of Cynthia Bartholomew:</strong> Awarded for helping
        the injured or poor under great threat or for an extended period. <q>Ms.
        Bart,</q> as the poor called her, was a Victorian humanitarian who
        always helped the poor and downtrodden. Once per act, the recipient can
        touch an ally to remove all shock. This is a simple action</li>

        <li><strong>Victoria Gloriana:</strong> Awarded after personally playing
        a Glory card. This prestigious award is only granted to the
        country&rsquo;s greatest heroes. The medal grants a +1 bonus to any one
        attribute and its linked skills, chosen when the medal is awarded. Note
        that if the medal is worn and the attribute or linked skill is used, it
        does cause a Contradiction</li>

        <li><strong>Possibility Wars Campaign Medal:</strong> Awarded to any
        Storm Knight who participates in a Glory event. The medal is awarded per
        cosm, and may be used once per act to restore 1 BD of shock. This does
        not require an action and may be used at any time</li>

        <li><strong>Sole Survivor Medal:</strong> Awarded to the one person to
        return from an otherwise doomed expedition. The Sole Survivor medal
        cancels the effects of The Law of Perseverance and its recipient may
        Soak damage normally in Orrorsh.</li>

        <li><strong>India Campaign Medal:</strong> Awarded to any Storm Knight
        who recovers an Eternity Shard inside Orrorsh. Once per act, the wearer
        may play a Destiny Card into her own Action Pool or the pool of an ally
        as a free reaction during any turn.</li>

        <li><strong>Order Vestigium:</strong> Awarded to those who defeat a
        Nightmare. <em>Evidence analysis</em> tests become Favored, and the
        character is automatically aware if any clue to a Nightmare&rsquo;s
        origin is nearby. This doesn&rsquo;t tell them what the clue is or where
        it can be found, just that something is afoot.</li>

        <li><strong>Order of the New Dawn:</strong> This medal is awarded to
        those who have been cursed, but managed to eliminate the being or force
        that cursed them. This award is a mixed blessing, as its presence also
        alerts Victorians that the wearer is cursed, which may lead to trust
        issues. The wearer&rsquo;s Corruption tests become Favored, and when a
        test fails the medal may be <q>burned</q> instead of losing Charisma. It
        still counts as a possessed Perk when determining the cost for buying
        new ones, but no longer has any other effect if burned.</li>

        <p>A long overcoat made from the treated skins of various beasts that
        once terrorized the innocent. The monsters of Orrorsh are notoriously
        hardy, so leather made from their hides is especially durable.</p>

      <h3>Overview</h3>

      <p>You are a Victorian, and your world, Gaea, is caught in the grip of the
      Gaunt Man’s horrors. You weren’t content to be ruled by terror, and so you
      fought back. Against all odds you survived, and the various tricks,
      gadgets, and special weapons you’ve acquired over years of battling evil
      have evened the odds considerably.</p>

      <p>When the Gaunt Man gathered his dark forces to travel through the
      maelstrom bridges and unleash their fury upon Core Earth, you followed to
      stalk them, just as you’ve always done.</p>

      <h3>Tactics</h3>

      <p>The special shells in your Slayer’s Gun gives you power and flexibility
      against specific foes, even outside of Orrorsh. Whenever you can,
      investigate what types of foes are likely to appear and prepare a custom
      load of shells to deal with them. Holy Water shells work well against
      gospog, a common enemy employed by all the High Lords. Even once all your
      specialized shells are used, your standard ammunition still packs a
      punch.</p>

      <p>You are highly resistant to fear and intimidation, but extremely
      vulnerable to taunt interactions. Victorians are notoriously haughty and
      intolerant of insults!</p>

      <h3>Moment of Crisis</h3>

      <p>Your crisis came long ago on Gaea. Maybe it was a werewolf, or perhaps
      it was a vampire. Whatever it was, it was a product of the Gaunt Man’s
      evil. Tracking it back to its lair was foolhardy, but your attempt
      triggered a change in you. As a Storm Knight you finally had the power to
      fight back.</p>

      <h3>Quote</h3>

      <p>“It’s easier to stop fearing a thing once you have the power to destroy
      it.“</p>

      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>Battling monsters is a dangerous profession, and you bear numerous
      scars attesting to that fact. Only some of those scars are visible.
      Victorians prefer modest dress, even in excruciating heat, and you’re no
      exception. Your distinctive coat made of strange leather and the ornately
      decorated, oversized Slayer’s Gun you carry are both giveaways to your
      profession.</p>

      <h3>Agenda</h3>

      <p>The destruction of evil is an imperative. If left to fester, monsters
      only become more vile and powerful. The High Lords, for all their tricks
      and facades, are just more monsters for you to stalk and terminate.</p>

      <h3>Names</h3>

      Winter</p>
